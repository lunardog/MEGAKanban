# メガ看板 (MEGAKanban)

> A Vue.js project

MEGA Kanban is meant to simulate a physical board with sticky cards, you know, for task management.

Building this for my coworkers, who work from home sometimes.

## Build Setup

First, get your firebase config from the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and put it in `config/config.json`.

Secondly, enable anonymous auth in your firebase console.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## DEMO:

## TODO:

 - [ ] user authentication (anonymous by default)
 - [ ] multiple boards (url based)
 - [ ] fix the dragging glitches
